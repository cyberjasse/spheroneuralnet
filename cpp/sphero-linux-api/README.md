# sphero-linux-api
Simple API for sphero 1 and 2.0 written in C++.

The API is (for now) built only over the bluez bluetooth stack, making it
compatible with most recent Linux distributions. It will NOT work on osx
systems as of now.

### How To build
#### 1. Dependencies

Dependencies are: bluez, libbluetooth, libbluetooth-dev, and libreadline6-dev
libncurses5 libncurses5-dev (and of course, classic compilation tools : g++,
make, gcc, clib, git, ...)

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt-get install bluez libbluetooth libbluetooth-dev git libreadline6-dev libncurses5 libncurses5-dev
  ```

Some distros may have libbluetooth called libbluetooth3 and libreadline6 called
libreadline, use your favorite package manager to figure out dependancies you
can't install using the provided command, these are quite usual packages so
they should be available for you

#### 2. Retrieving the source code

  * either download the
    [.zip](https://github.com/slock83/sphero-linux-api/archive/master.zip) from
    this page and extract it

  $ cd sphero-linux-api/sphero-api
  $ make
  ```
